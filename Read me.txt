Problem:

The Human Activity Recognition dataset was created from sensor recordings of 30 participants performing activities of daily living while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone. Our aim is to address the activity carried out to one of our existing six classes: laying, standing, sitting, walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs.

The experiments were carried out with a group of 30 participants aged 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities by wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on their waist. Using the accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axis linear acceleration and 3-axis angular velocity were captured at a constant 50Hz rate. Experiments were videotaped in order to be able to manually label the data. The obtained data set was randomly divided into two groups, and 70% of the participants were selected to create the training data and 30% to create the test data.

However, the following parameters are provided for each record in the dataset:
1. Triaxial acceleration from accelerometer and estimated body acceleration.
2. Three-axis angular velocity from the gyroscope.
3. A 561 feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
4. Activity tag.
5. The identifier of the participant performing the experiment.
